### Good to go
[ Ok] this my first deployment, and it's on Heroku, this is the link
[BOOM](https://morning-headland-49414.herokuapp.com/), and it's working,
but I'm on a free tier, whateva that means, and could be slow, so
please don't login too many people on the same time!

[ Ok], so couple of words, about the project. It's not difficult, but
it's not trivial as well. The above code is a framework created from
*Node.js's* ``npx create-react-app`` command, the frontend source is in
``src/App.js`` and ``src/App.css`` files. Backend is at ``api/canvas.py``.
The ``Submit`` button is making the *GET/POST* requests to the ***flask***
routes. Having *MNIST* digits finding nearest neighbor is easy, but the
main difficulty is prepossessing images to the MNIST format, for this
the program uses numpy, PIL.Image and matplotlib.pyplot modules.
***React*** is a fun way to create components with randomly changing
background and stof.
